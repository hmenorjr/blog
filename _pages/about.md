            traffic is important for bloggers and people who writes for a living. Thus, creating his own blog site instead. If you ever wonder of the reasoning of the logo,
            that is the letter "M" of Younger Futhark. You can find more here: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannaz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannaz</a>
